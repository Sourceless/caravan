#+title: Create A Character

* Characters in Caravan
Player characters in Caravan are *Adventurers*. This means that they are people
who dive into the unknown and enter the fray without fretting overly about their
safety.

Players must create characters with the drive to go on adventures.

Nothing venturend, nothing gained.

* Character sheet
The character sheet is made up of a number of different parts, each of which
affect who your character is and their abilities within the world.

** Attributes
Attributes are about your intrinsic power and potential. You can gain (and
lose!) attribute points over time.

Attributes fall in the range of 1-20. 10 is an average among adventurers,
and 8 is the average amongst commoners. 1 represents complete enfeeblement
in some regard. 20 represents being the best possible, given mortal constraints.

There are three attributes:
*** Body
This attribute represents the adventurer's connection with and investment in
their physicality.

*** Mind
This attribute represents intelligence and keenness of thought, as well as
knowledge gained through experience or education.

*** Presence
This attribute represents your ability to influence others in social situations,
and how people react when you walk into a room.

** Attribute Modifiers
When rolling against an attribute, you actually roll against an attribute modifier.

Refer to the table below to convert attribute scorse to their modifiers

| Attribute Score | Modifier |
|-----------------+----------|
|               1 |       -5 |
|             2-3 |       -4 |
|             4-5 |       -3 |
|             6-7 |       -2 |
|             8-9 |       -1 |
|           10-11 |        0 |
|           12-13 |       +1 |
|           14-15 |       +2 |
|           16-17 |       +3 |
|           18-19 |       +4 |
|              20 |       +5 |


** Skills
Skills are ways for your character to interact with the world. Each skill uses a
combination of your abilities to determine a skill score.

If you can't find a skill to fit a particular situation, use /Improvisation/.

Each skill roll is based on 3 attribute rolls, which appear in brackets following
the skill name. For example, `(BBB)` means you should make three Body rolls and
add them together

*** Athletics (BBB)

run, jump, push, pull, throw -- anything like that.
