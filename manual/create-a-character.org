#+title: Create A Character

* Characters in Caravan
Player characters in Caravan are *Adventurers*. This means that they are people
who dive into the unknown and enter the fray without fretting overly about their
safety.

Players must create characters with the drive to go on adventures.

Nothing venturend, nothing gained.

* Character sheet
The character sheet is made up of a number of different parts, each of which
affect who your character is and their abilities within the world.

** Attributes
Attributes are about your intrinsic power and potential. You can gain (and
lose!) attribute points over time.

Attributes fall in the range of 1-20. 10 is an average among adventurers,
and 8 is the average amongst commoners. 1 represents complete enfeeblement
in some regard. 20 represents being the best possible, given mortal constraints.

There are three attributes:
*** Body
This attribute represents the adventurer's connection with and investment in
their physicality.

*** Mind
This attribute represents intelligence and keenness of thought, as well as
knowledge gained through experience or education.

*** Presence
This attribute represents your ability to influence others in social situations,
and how people react when you walk into a room.

** Attribute Modifiers
When rolling against an attribute, you actually roll against an attribute modifier.

Refer to the table below to convert attribute scorse to their modifiers

| Attribute Score | Modifier |
|-----------------+----------|
|               1 |       -5 |
|             2-3 |       -4 |
|             4-5 |       -3 |
|             6-7 |       -2 |
|             8-9 |       -1 |
|           10-11 |        0 |
|           12-13 |       +1 |
|           14-15 |       +2 |
|           16-17 |       +3 |
|           18-19 |       +4 |
|              20 |       +5 |


** Skills
Skills are ways for your character to interact with the world. Each skill uses a
combination of your abilities to determine a skill score.

If you can't find a skill to fit a particular situation, use /Improvisation/.

Each skill roll is based on three attribute modifiers, which appear in brackets
following the skill name. For example, `(BBB)` means you should make a d20 roll
with a bonus of three times the body modifier.

Skills:
*** Athletics (BBB)
Athletics is your ability to exercise your raw physical prowess on the world:
run, jump, push, pull, throw -- anything like that.
*** Perception (BBM)
This is your ability to spot things that might help or harm you.
*** Performance (BBP)
This is your ability to use your body to impress or distract others.
*** Invention (BMM)

things.
*** Improvisation (BMP)
This is your most general skill - your ability to make up solutions on the fly.

*** Logic (MMM)

*** Negotiation (MMP)

*** Investigation (MPP)

*** Charm (PPP)

** Class
Your character's class defines the abilities they'll have access to, weapons
they can use, and spells they can cast. In parentheses after each are their most
important attributes.

The classes are:
*** Soldier (B)

faster, hit harder, and keep coming back swinging. Outside of combat, their
strength and endurance are of great use when it comes to surviving the harsh
desert.

in their enemies and exploit them to great effect. Outside of combat, Engineers

cannot win. Strategists support and direct others to their greatest effect.

their team together and protect them.

* Creating a new character
** 1. Roll your attributes
Roll 3d6 3 times and note down the result each time. These are your attribute
points. You can choose which attributes to apply them to.

If you roll beneath 25 points total, you may reroll.

** 2. Choose a class
Choose one of the classes above. On the class page, there is a description of
how to set up your character for first level.

** 3. Choose your starting equipment
Take either the standard equipment on the class page, or buy equipment from the
starting equipment list up to the value of 1000 gold. You do not keep any
excess gold, so spend as much as you can.

** 4. Describe your character
Come up with a backstory for your character (even if it's short!), and decide
what their goal is. Then, describe their physical attributes, such as their
sex and gender presentation, height, weight, skin colour, eye colour, hair
colour and style, and anything else you can think of.

Remember that your character must be ready to survive long and arduous
journeys, so make sure they are in shape to do so (and if they're not,
that they have some other way around it).
